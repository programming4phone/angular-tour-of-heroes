# Angular Tour Of Heroes

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

## Tutorial improvements

+ Entire tutorial code base built from scratch using `angular-cli`.
+ Code base modified to use Semantic UI.
+ Added description and power ratings to Hero objects.
+ Replaced all occurrences of Promise with Observable in HeroService.
+ Replaced  `angular2-in-memory-web-api` with `angular-in-memory-web-api`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

HeroService and HeroSearchService both use `angular-in-memory-web-api` which can be installed by executing `npm i angular-in-memory-web-api` from the command line on the project folder.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
